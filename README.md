# Satisfactory-Area-Calculator
This is a program to help plan out area and concrete for Satisfactory

The goal will be to help make something that will let someone input the buildings that they want and the concrete size they are hoping for (maybe also the number of layers/levels that a person wants) and it will output the number of concrete slabs that will be needed.
